# Semantic Markup Exercise

To get started, fork and clone this repository.

The *index.html* document is marked up with many `<div>` and `<span>` tags. Examine their content and change them to semantic HTML tags.

Once you're finished, check your HTML document for errors with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).

## Success Criteria:

1. HTML passes W3C validation
1. Includes `header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`, `aside`
1. Includes `ul` and `ols` where appropriate

> See the [success_criteria.md](success_criteria.md) file for further details
